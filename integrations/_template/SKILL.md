# Making an integration

An integration is a plugin: one folder with a manifest, English and Russian texts, a server module with tools,
and optionally a card that shows results in the chat. This folder is a complete working one (sunrise and sunset
from sunrise-sunset.org): copy it and change what it does, keep its shape.

```
<id>/
  .piomio-plugin/plugin.json         manifest: id, name, the catalog card, permissions, tools, widgets, settings
  .piomio-plugin/locales/en.json     every text a person reads (English is the source and the fallback)
  .piomio-plugin/locales/ru.json     the same keys in Russian
  server/index.ts                    the tools (TypeScript run directly by Node: no build)
  ui/src/index.tsx                   the card (widget) drawn in the chat, optional
  test/<id>.test.ts                  tests against a fake of the service (in the Piomio repository)
  package.json                       the folder's npm name; `dependencies` only if truly needed
```

## Before you build

1. Call hub_integrations_list: if something already does it, turn it on (hub_integration_connect) instead.
2. Ask the user only what you cannot find out: which service, and whether it needs their account or a key.
   Prefer services that work without a key. Never ask for a key in the chat as text: a key goes into the vault
   through the setup card (see Secrets).

## Steps

1. Pick an id: lowercase letters, digits and dashes, 2–41 characters (e.g. `air-quality`). Tools are exposed as
   `<id with _ for ->_<tool name>`.
2. Copy this skill's folder into your workspace as `integrations/<id>/`, without this SKILL.md.
3. `.piomio-plugin/plugin.json`:
   - `id`; `name` and `description` stay `"%name%"` / `"%description%"` (the texts live in the locales);
   - delete `"builtin"` and `"defaultEnabled"`: an integration installed on a hub is turned on when it is installed;
   - `integration`: `category` (everyday, travel, money, work, reading, communication, home, assistant), `icon`
     (a Lucide icon name, e.g. `cloud-sun`, `plane`, `wallet`), `logo` for a real service (`"./logo.png"`: its logo
     as a 128×128 PNG in the folder, at most 64 KB; the catalog draws it on a white tile instead of the icon),
     `connect` (`none`; `setup` when it needs a key or setup; `signin` for a service's own MCP server with a browser
     sign-in, see below), `summary` and `example` (`"%integration.summary%"`, `"%integration.example%"`); no `popular`;
     `"localApp": true` when its tools drive an app on the hub's own computer (Blender): a task whose brain runs on
     another computer then does not get them and uses that computer's own app;
   - `permissions.network`: the exact hosts it calls (`api.example.com`, `*.example.com`); never `"*"` unless the
     user gives the addresses at run time;
   - `contributes.widgets`: the card kinds the tools show (`[]` and no `ui` when there is no card);
   - `contributes.settings`: a JSON Schema of the person's settings, only if there are any.
4. `locales/en.json` and `locales/ru.json`: the same keys, natural text in each language. Tool descriptions and tool
   results are for the model: English, in the code, not in the locales.
5. `server/index.ts`: register the tools in `activate(ctx)`.
   - A tool has a `name`, a `description` that tells the model when to use it and what to pass, an `inputSchema`,
     and an `effect`: `read` (looks something up), `local-write` (changes something on the hub), `external` (acts in
     the world: sends, books, pays; the user approves each call). Set `source: true` when the result comes from
     outside (web pages, APIs).
   - Validate the input and answer mistakes with `isError` text the model can act on. Catch network errors; use
     `AbortSignal.timeout(…)` on every request; send a User-Agent naming Piomio.
   - To show a card: `ctx.widgets.show(call, "<kind>", data)` with plain JSON (under 64 KB), and say in the result's
     text that a card is shown so the model does not repeat it.
   - Read settings from `ctx.settings` and `ctx.onSettingsChange`. Keep an address setting (`apiUrl`) for tests.
   - Only erasable TypeScript: no enums, namespaces or parameter properties; `import type` for types. No npm
     packages unless unavoidable (then list them in package.json `dependencies`; they install without scripts).
6. `ui/src/index.tsx`: one file that imports only `react` and `@piomio/ui` (and `import type` from the server). It
   draws each widget kind with `ui.widgets.add(kind, Component)`; texts come from `ui.i18n.t`. Style with inline
   styles and the page's CSS variables (`var(--muted)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--surface-2)`, `var(--accent)`). The hub
   compiles it when installing.
7. Check it: `node --check` cannot read TypeScript, so run `node server/index.ts` from the folder: it must exit with
   no error. Read your manifest and both locale files once more: every `"%key%"` must exist in both.
8. Install: call hub_plugin_install with `source: "integrations/<id>"`. The user sees what it asks for and allows
   it. Then tell them in a sentence what it does and suggest the example to try. To change it, edit the folder and
   install again: the new version replaces the old one.

## Secrets

A key or token never goes into the code, the settings or the chat. Declare it and the hub asks for it on a setup
card, straight into the vault:

```json
"contributes": { "setup": { "secrets": [ { "vault": "<id>_api_key", "setting": "apiKey", "title": "%setup.key.title%",
  "hint": "%setup.key.hint%", "link": "https://example.com/account/keys", "required": true } ] } },
"permissions": { "vault": ["<id>_api_key"] }
```

and set `"connect": "setup"` in `integration`. In the code: `const { value } = await ctx.vault.get("vault://<id>_api_key")`
when a tool needs it; when it is missing, answer that the user should connect the integration (hub_plugin_setup shows
the card).

## A service with its own MCP server

When the service runs an official MCP server (Streamable HTTP, often with a browser sign-in: Granola, for one), the
integration needs no code: a manifest, the locales and an `.mcp.json` beside `.piomio-plugin/` (see
`integrations/granola`):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "<id>": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp" } } }
```

Name the server like the integration's id, so its tools are `<id>_<tool>`. With `"connect": "signin"` the hub signs in
for the person (OAuth discovery, client registration, PKCE; the tokens go into the vault): the catalog and its card in
the chat show a Sign in button. A built-in integration may list the server's tools that only read in `"readTools"`
(they then run without asking); other tools ask the person each time.

A server that runs on this computer (stdio) is a `command` instead of a `url`. `${PIOMIO_NODE}` is the hub's own Node
(a launcher written in TypeScript runs on it, nothing to install), `${PIOMIO_PLUGIN_ROOT}` the integration's folder and
`${PIOMIO_PLUGIN_DATA}` its data folder; the server reaches only the hosts in `permissions.network`. When it cannot
start, it says why on stderr and exits: its last line is what the person sees on the integration. `integrations/blender`
is one: its launcher finds the app, prepares the official server and relays MCP to it.

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "<id>": { "command": "${PIOMIO_NODE}", "args": ["${PIOMIO_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp/launch.ts"], "env": { "DATA": "${PIOMIO_PLUGIN_DATA}" } } } }
```

## Several apps through one outside service

An integration that connects many apps through a hosted service (`integrations/composio`: Slack, GitHub, Gmail… via
Composio) lists each app as a catalog entry of its own, and says which outside service they go through:

```json
"integration": {
  "category": "other", "icon": "plug", "connect": "setup", "summary": "%integration.summary%",
  "via": { "name": "Composio", "about": "%via.about%", "link": "https://composio.dev" },
  "entries": [{ "id": "slack", "name": "Slack", "summary": "%entry.slack%", "category": "work", "icon": "message-square", "example": "%example.slack%" }]
}
```

- Entries show in the catalog as `<id>:<entry>` (`composio:slack`), even while the integration is off. `via` puts the
  service's badge on each; its `about` (`{name}` is the entry's name) is the note the badge opens: say plainly who
  keeps the account's keys and who sees the calls.
- The running plugin reports every entry's state, and entries it adds, with `ctx.catalog.update([{ id, status, connect,
  account?, detail? }])` (`status`: `connected`, `needs-setup` or `broken`; `connect`: `setup` while its own key is
  missing, else `signin`). Added entries carry `name`, `summary`, `category`, `icon` too; keep them in `ctx.storage`
  and report them again on start.
- `ctx.catalog.onSignIn(entry => ({ url }))` gives the address of the entry's Sign in button; report the entry
  `connected` once it works (poll the service: nothing comes back to the hub, so a phone can sign in too), and the
  chat that asked hears it. `ctx.catalog.onSignOut(entry => …)` signs it out; `ctx.tools.unregister(name)` takes back
  its tools.

## In the Piomio repository

Built-in integrations live in `integrations/` (this template is `integrations/_template`). People adding one work only
in its folder:

- `npm run new:integration -- <id>` copies this template to `integrations/<id>/` with the id filled in;
- built-in ones keep `"builtin": true` and `"defaultEnabled": false` (they wait in the catalog until turned on);
  `"popular": <n>` puts one among the catalog's popular picks;
- test with `@piomio/testkit`'s `startPlugin` against a fake of the service (see `test/sun.test.ts`), then
  `npx vitest run integrations/<id>`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build:ui-plugins`;
- every text a person reads goes through the locales; `packages/core/test/i18n.test.ts` checks both languages.

The plugin API in full: `docs/plugins.md` in the repository.
